# Enki Theme (Material Design Inspired)

A color scheme and UI theme originally for **Sublime Text** (ported to **Visual Studio Code**) with clear, disparate colors to help differentiate between all syntactic aspects of code, including syntax highlighting for the console.

This was the project of [enkia](https://github.com/enkia/enki-theme) so all credits goes to him/her. I was already using this theme locally and I simply loved it so I thought why not share it with love? Thanks so much for your awesome work. :)
